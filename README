DESCRIPTION
===========

freeAML is an easy-to-use, free and open-source Applied Mathematics Library.

It contains many linear system solvers, least square solvers, matrix
factorization algorithms and more. It was created based on the work I have done
during my PhD at the UCLA Department of Mathematics.

I have not performed any tests with this library in a Windows environment; I
only run tests inside of a Linux environment. I will not attempt to modify the
code to make it compile with any Windows compiler, but please feel free to it
if you wish.

If you wish to contribute to this project in any way, go for it! :-)


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

You do not need to compile the library to use it, but if you wish to generate
the doxygen-based documentation, enter the 'doc' directory and run

$ doxygen Doxyfile

If you do not have doxygen installed and if you are using a Debian-based
distribution, open a terminal and run:

$ sudo apt-get install doxygen


EXAMPLES
========

You can find examples at http://freeaml.org.
